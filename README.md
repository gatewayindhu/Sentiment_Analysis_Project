# Sentiment_Analysis_Project
Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and categorizing emotions (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques.
Data Collection: Gather text data from sources like social media, reviews, or surveys.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by removing noise (e.g., stopwords, punctuation, and emojis) and tokenizing text.
Feature Extraction: Convert text into numerical format using methods like TF-IDF, Bag of Words, or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec).
Model Building: Train ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) or deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, Transformers) for classification.
Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Present results with graphs to show sentiment trends.
